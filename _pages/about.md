I am a statistician specializing in Data Sciences. I am an expert in data wrangling, analytics and machine learning methods.
I studied statistics at the Bicocca University of Milan for 5 years. One of my goals is to improve every time, to do so I always find the opportunity to learn something new. This is my personal portfolio in which I will share all the projects I have done over the years.
